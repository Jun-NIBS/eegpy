*********************************
Welcome to eegpy's documentation!
*********************************

eegpy is intended to simplify the processing and analysis of EEG
(Electroencephalography) and similar data in a free environment
(free like beer AND speech).

It is written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and makes
extensive use of widely used scientific libraries, e.g `NumPy
<http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ and `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_.
