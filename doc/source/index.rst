Welcome to eegpy's documentation!
*********************************

eegpy is intended to simplify the processing and analysis of EEG (Electroencephalography) and similar data
in a free environment (free like beer AND speech). 

It is written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and makes extensive use of widely used scientific libraries, e.g `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ and `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_.
